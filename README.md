My solutions to exercises from Kernighan & Richie "The C Programming Language" (Second Edition).

I'm using the exercises as an opportunity to explore various features of the C language and also elements of C++.  So the solutions I provide here:

a) May be massively over-engineered simply to try out something that I find interesting.

b) Are unlikely to be completely idiomatic in any single version of C/C++.

c) May contain rookie errors (although hopefully I will be clearing these up as I go!)
